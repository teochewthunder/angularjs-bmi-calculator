# AngularJS BMI Calculator
This uses a HTML front-end with AngularJS placeholders. JavaScript is used as a controller to process input from the HTML and send output back to the HTML.

## HTML
Basic inputs for height and weight. We use *type=range* so that we get a pair of sliders. *height_cm* and *weight_g* are the scope variables.

## JavaScript
There are functions for unit conversion and BMI calculation. A message is created based on the BMI calculated, and sent back to the HTML using the scope variable *remarks*.

## Notes
All in all, it's just a very simple AngularJS demo that shows data-binding and scope variables.
